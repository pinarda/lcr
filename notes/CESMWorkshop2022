Addressing the large-data storage problem at NCAR requires judicious use of data compression algorithms. Our solution to compression algorithm and parameter selection is to use an extendable suite of metrics, which we developed to identify spatiotemporal compression artifacts that may impact post-hoc scientific analysis of a climate dataset. These metrics include the DSSIM, Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value, spatial relative error, and Pearson correlation coefficient. A simple brute-force method to compression CESM model output is infeasible, because it would require computing each of these metrics on every time-slice of the output with every possible combination of compression parameters. Instead, we aim to create a statistical model to predict the optimal compression settings using a subset of CESM-LENS data. In this presentation, we discuss our current attempts at modeling compression settings using both spatial and single-value features based on the original dataset.
