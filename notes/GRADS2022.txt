Detecting Compression Artifacts in Massive Spatiotemporal Datasets

Numerical simulations are key tools used in the investigation and prediction of Earthâ€™s climate.
These simulations track hundreds of climate variables at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
Consequently, the amount of disk storage required to store the output data for a large-scale simulation
is massive and scientists are forced to make hard decisions about what data to keep and what to discard.
To alleviate this problem, data reduction methods such as lossy compression are needed. Lossy compression
involves information loss, and care must be taken to carefully compress the data to avoid affecting scientific
conclusions based on the data. Here, we present an approach developed with scientists at the National Center
for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to apply lossy compression to output data from the Community Earth System Model
(CESM). In particular, we show how we use statistical techniques such as the Pearson correlation coefficient,
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to capture compression artifacts.
Each of these metrics can capture classes of compression error, and we critically explore the advantages
and shortcoming of each. Finally, we discuss the role these metrics play in efficiently classifying datasets
according to their optimal compression setting.
